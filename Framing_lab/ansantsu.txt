I cut him down so he'll spring back up. The boy's enormously talented, there's no denying that. But he's a novice. He's not yet learned how to be worthy of that talent. He refuses to meet any challenge except on his own terms. He doesn't see the true value of competition. To a young person for whom everything comes easily, the pain of defeat can be a much needed wake-up call.

On the surface the whole concept of exams may seem arbitrary, but deep down, it's not about grades, it's about rising to the occasion. It's about tasting the rapture an triumph and disgrace of failure. They go hand in hand you see. One is meaningless without the other. To win, one has to lose! The difference between the novice and the master is that the master has failed more times than the novice has tried.
